The Concept: "Companion Mode"
The Admin Panel will have two views: the Desktop View (Command Center) and the Mobile View (Scanner & Quick Actions).

1. How the Workflow Happens
The Setup: The receptionist sits at the desk with the Laptop/PC open showing the Booking Dashboard.

The Trigger: A customer walks in. The receptionist picks up their own mobile phone (which is logged into the Admin website).

The Action: On the mobile, they tap a big floating "Scan QR" button. The camera opens.

The Scan: They point the phone at the customer's WhatsApp/Ticket.

The Sync (The Magic Moment):

The phone beeps/vibrates (Success!).

Instantly, on the Laptop screen in front of them, the booking status automatically flips from "Pending" to "Checked In" (Green) without them touching the mouse or refreshing the page.

If payment is pending, the Laptop screen pops up a red alert: "Collect ₹500 Balance."

2. Technical Implementation Features
To make this user-friendly, we need to focus on these specific technical aspects:

A. Progressive Web App (PWA)

You don't need to build a separate Android/iOS app. Build the Admin Panel as a PWA.

This allows the admin to "Install" the website on their phone home screen. It will look and feel like a native app, access the camera permissions easily, and run smoothly.

B. Real-Time WebSockets (Socket.io)

This is the most critical tech stack requirement.

When the phone scans the code, it sends a signal to the server. The server uses WebSockets to push that update immediately to the open Laptop dashboard.

Result: Zero latency. It feels like magic to the user.

C. "Scan-to-Action" Logic When the QR is scanned, the mobile screen shouldn't just say "Done." It should act as a mini-controller.

Scenario: Admin scans a code.

Mobile Screen shows: "Booking Valid: Court A."

Mobile Options:

[Check In] (Primary Button)

[Add Water Bottle] (Upsell)

[Report Issue]

3. Why this is better than Hardware Scanners?
Mobility: The admin can walk to the gate, the parking lot, or the specific turf to check people in. They aren't chained to the desk cable.

Cost: Hardware scanners cost money and break. Phones are already owned by staff.

Context: A hardware scanner just inputs numbers. A phone screen can show details (e.g., "This is a VIP customer" or "This customer is blacklisted") right in the palm of the hand immediately after scanning.

4. Advanced "Mobile Admin" Features
Since the admin is already using their phone to scan, you can add a few more "on-the-go" features to the mobile view:

Payment Collection via UPI:

Admin scans the user's ticket -> System says "₹200 Pending."

Admin clicks "Collect UPI" on their mobile.

It opens the admin's UPI app (GPay/PhonePe) or generates a Dynamic QR code on the admin's phone screen for the customer to scan and pay right there.

Court Photo Upload:

If a customer complains "The net is broken," the admin walks to the court, takes a photo with the mobile admin panel, and it instantly attaches to the "Maintenance Log" on the main server.
